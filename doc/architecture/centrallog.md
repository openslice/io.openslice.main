# Central Logging

Openslice follows the centralized log management concept, i.e. a type of logging solution system that consolidates the log data from different services and pushes it to a central, accessible and easy-to-use interface. 

For that reason, Elasticsearch is elected as an open-source centralized logging solution for collecting, parsing and storing logs towards a real-time data analytics tool that provides insights from any type of structured and unstructured data source.
