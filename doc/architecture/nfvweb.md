# Openslice NFV Web Portal

The [NFV Web Portal](http://portal.openslice.io/nfvportal) offers a domain-specific UI to manage NFV Services.

Indicatively, the portal can be used to:
- Register new a new MANO provider (e.g. OSM)
- Synchronize the onboarded VNF/NS packages, and the VIMs of the registered MANO provider
- Onboard/Delete VNF/NS packages on specific MANO provider
- Deploy a NS to a target MANO provider
